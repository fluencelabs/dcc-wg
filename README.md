# Decentralized Choreography and Composition WG

With the increasing prevalence of decentralized, distributed compute both on- and off-chain, commensurate choreography and composition protocols are required.

While there are different implementation models for DCC engines, e.g., calculi or state machines, expectations of efficient validation and verification of execution (traces) are often expected.

The purpose of the DCC-WG is to establish

- orchestration models for complex multi-agent permissioned and permissionless p2p networks
- efficient verification and validation models and processes for both on- and off-chain scenarios. For example, an on-chain solution might implement the DCC engine on-chain and (probabilistically) verify and validate DCC execution traces. Alternatively, a DCC engine might be implemented as a ZK for off-chain verification and validation
- on- and off-chain proof models fundamentally independent of the DCC engine implementation and the verification and validation approach
- formalization approaches over different DCC implementation models for shared reasoning, e.g., via (vanilla) Petri nets or DAGs
- best practices for payload security and privacy, e.g., e2e
